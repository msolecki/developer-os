# Monitoring and alerting rules

- Alert on SYMPTOMS such as error rate above 1%, p99 above 2 seconds, or a growing queue; do not page on causes such as CPU above 80% or memory use. Causes belong on dashboards.
- Prevent alert fatigue. If an alert fires three times without action, tune its threshold or remove it. An ignored alert is worse than no alert.
- Every P1 alert links to a runbook that says what to inspect, what to restart, and whom to escalate to. Do not add an alert without a runbook.
- Separate `/health` for process liveness and load balancers from `/ready` for dependency readiness and orchestration. A health check does not query the database.
- Add a new metric or alert in the same change as the feature it observes. Do not defer monitoring to an unspecified later task.
